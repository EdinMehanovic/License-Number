# License-Number
## Description
#### Here we have a program in which the user is asked to enter in their first, middle, last name, birth month, and birth day, and this results in giving the user their license number. We pull this number from the list we created in excel to help determine what values go where for the license number. There is error prevention code so the user does not crash the program when typing an incorrect value for any of the listed questions. And if the users wants to, they can run the program again.
## How to View
#### Sign into GitHub and run a codespace on the repository, then select 'AssignmentEM11.py' and run the code to be able to interact with the program. If you are not able to sign-in, then simply look over to both 'Output1.PNG' and 'Output2.PNG' to see an example of what the program outputs.
